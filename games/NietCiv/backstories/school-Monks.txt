* Monks Schools of Learning
(Monk) adds to Priests Guild Level and Physical Learning, Training and Practicing
(Mage) adds to Mages Guild Level and Magic Learning, Practicing and Training
(Monk) + (Mage) adds to Transcendance Level and Spirtual Learning

NOTE: You dont NEED to be a Monk to learn Martial Arts, but it helps, and there are some things you cant learn, like any Ninja Path. Also to be a Ninja, you have to have "allegence to a House". And If you are a Samurai without "allegence to a House", you can still continue as a Rohan if you get a Horse.
