* Mages Schools of Learning
(Mage) adds to Mages Guild Level and Magic Learning
(Monk) adds to Priests Guild Level and Physical Learning
(Mage) + (Monk) adds to Transcendance Level and Spirtual Learning

NOTE: You dont NEED to be a Mage to learn Magical Arts, but it helps, and there are some things you cant learn, like any Specialist Path. Also to be a Ninja, you have to have "allegence to a House". And If you are a Samurai without "allegence to a House", you can still continue as a Rohan if you get a Horse.
