These are vertrex rotation tests originally done in GW-BASIC or QBASIC/QuickBasic
so they are designed for 320x200 resolution, and they use their key codes.

keys
 a   straif left  (move left looking forward)
 s   straif right (move right looking forward)
 p   move forwards
 h   move backwards
 m   turn left
 k   turn right

The programs are "proof of concept", used to quickly get the maths verified, 
which are then used to program a C/C++ version of the code, without having to 
worry about certain details of the program structure.

They are part of a video presentaion done by a Finnish programmer whose nickname 
is bisqwit. The original code and a link to the YouTube video can be found here:
